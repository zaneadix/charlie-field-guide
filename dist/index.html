			<h3 class="blocked">Foreword</h3>

			<p>In 5th grade, I was presented with the opportunity to wear an orange sash, miss an hour of class (right before lunch!), and permission to boss kindergartners and rowdy bus riders. “Safety” was the title my school bestowed upon those worthy of this great responsibility. I politely declined after a day of consideration and I remember my teacher being very surprised. She later asked me, in an empty-ish classroom, why I opted to forgo this magical mashup of power that catered to the budding control-freak-bully in me. My 11-year-old self cited the desire to not fall behind in class. But for real, I’m no snitch. Nine years later I’m wrangling a puppy that prefers to walk backwards so he can keep an eye on me. I like to think that Charlie came into my life to be the Safety so I don’t have to. A vocal, grumpy safety.</p>
