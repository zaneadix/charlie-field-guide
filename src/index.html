			<h3 class="blocked">Foreword</h3>

			<p>In 5th grade, I was presented with the opportunity to wear an orange sash, miss an hour of class (right before lunch!), and permission to boss kindergartners and rowdy bus riders. “Safety” was the title my school bestowed upon those worthy of this great responsibility. I politely declined after a day of consideration and I remember my teacher being very surprised. She later asked me, in an empty-ish classroom, why I opted to forgo this magical mashup of power that catered to the budding control-freak-bully in me. My 11-year-old self cited the desire to not fall behind in class. But for real, I’m no snitch. Nine years later I’m wrangling a puppy that prefers to walk backwards so he can keep an eye on me. I like to think that Charlie came into my life to be the Safety so I don’t have to. A vocal, grumpy safety.</p>

				<p>It’s very important to make sure Charlie doesn’t backslide*. He can be pretty manipulative once he activates neglected dog face. He is also a contender for world champion of perma-sad dog face, so keep this in mind.</p>

						<p class="text">Charlie has a built-in alarm with two distinct sounds. One is a sharp, piercing bark and the other is a high-pitched whimper that sounds like a dying battery in a smoke detector. One is activated when he senses peril (or fun) anywhere in the world, but more specifically on the other side of the door. Also triggered by strangers near or in the house, cats being rowdy, mailmen, any loud sound and literally fire alarms (smoke detectors). The other is activated by feeling left out.</p>

						<p class="text">Charlie becomes a difficult dog ballerina whenever it rains. He will refuse to go outside, tip toe around the yard and be very dramatic about using the bathroom on already wet things. Charlie takes pride in watering things with his pee, so rain is confusing for him.</p>

				<p>Officer Charlie likes to go outside at least 5 times a day. He is great at walking when wearing his head collar, but otherwise a nightmare on a string. You can consider this Charlie’s walking safety belt that he must wear when leaving the house grounds when he needs to potty and patrol the neighborhood.</p>

				<p>This is easy. If you’ve ever tapped someone on the shoulder or grazed a couch on your way to the fridge, you really can’t go wrong here except if you’re too aggressive. If you fear your ability to properly pet Charlie, you can practice by resting a hand on a friend’s head or scratching your shoulder.</p>

			<p>When Charlie completes one of these commands, always reward him with praise + pet or a cookie. Never both. They are equally weighted. No one should be praised for eating a cookie. </p>
