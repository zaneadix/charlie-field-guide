			<h3 class="blocked">Foreword</h3>

			<p>In 5th grade, I was presented with the opportunity to wear an orange sash, miss an hour of class (right before lunch!), and permission to boss kindergartners and rowdy bus riders. “Safety” was the title my school bestowed upon those worthy of this great responsibility. I politely declined after a day of consideration and I remember my teacher being very surprised. She later asked me, in an empty-ish classroom, why I opted to forgo this magical mashup of power that catered to the budding control-freak-bully in me. My 11-year-old self cited the desire to not fall behind in class. But for real, I’m no snitch. Nine years later I’m wrangling a puppy that prefers to walk backwards so he can keep an eye on me. I like to think that Charlie came into my life to be the Safety so I don’t have to. A vocal, grumpy safety.</p>

				<p>It’s very important to make sure Charlie doesn’t backslide*. He can be pretty manipulative once he activates neglected dog face. He is also a contender for world champion of perma-sad dog face, so keep this in mind.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="right col-md-6">

				<h2>Backslide</h2>

				<h4 class="pronunciation">[bak•slyd]</h4>

						<h4 class="name">1000 Kisses</h4>

						<h4 class="name">Statue Dog</h4>
						<p class="text">Warning. Super still dogs are a sign of waiting for your food to drop or the kind of concentration that is about to explode into.</p>

					<li>

						<span class="icon"><img class="wide down" src="images/whistleblower@1x.png" alt=""></span>
						<h4 class="name">Whistle Blower</h4>
						<p class="text">Charlie has a built-in alarm with two distinct sounds. One is a sharp, piercing bark and the other is a high-pitched whimper that sounds like a dying battery in a smoke detector. One is activated when he senses peril (or fun) anywhere in the world, but more specifically on the other side of the door. Also triggered by strangers near or in the house, cats being rowdy, mailmen, any loud sound and literally fire alarms (smoke detectors). The other is activated by feeling left out.</p>

					</li>

					<li>

						<span class="icon"><img class="wide-shrink down" src="images/wetpaws@1x.png" alt=""></span>
						<h4 class="name">Wet Paws</h4>
						<p class="text">Charlie becomes a difficult dog ballerina whenever it rains. He will refuse to go outside, tip toe around the yard and be very dramatic about using the bathroom on already wet things. Charlie takes pride in watering things with his pee, so rain is confusing for him.</p>

					</li>

					<li>

						<span class="icon"><img class="high up-half" src="images/leaningtower@1x.png" alt=""></span>
						<h4 class="name">Lean Tower</h4>
						<p class="text">Imagine you live in the country and that you and Charlie are a primitive form of protection from the elements.  You’re going to be the thing that gets leaned on so that Charlie feels happy and safe.</p>

				<p class="description">Cookie Time is a working snack session. Charlie must perform a low barrier task in order to receive a cookie. ONE. COOKIE.</p>

				<p class="title"><strong>Beware:</strong></p>

				<p class="description">Charlie loves trash. Trash is a fun treat in his dog brain. Be mindful of all that and unfinished food items out in dog-reachable areas. If left unsupervised, Charlie will indulge in any and all things in dog reach because he is an opportunist*.</p>

				<h3 class="blocked">Walks</h3>

				<p>Officer Charlie likes to go outside at least 5 times a day. He is great at walking when wearing his head collar, but otherwise a nightmare on a string. You can consider this Charlie’s walking safety belt that he must wear when leaving the house grounds when he needs to potty and patrol the neighborhood.</p>

						<h4 class="name">Skateboards</h4>
						<p class="text">Charlie may have experienced death in a former life as a result of a skateboarding accident, which may explain his vehement objection to them. If skateboarding does occur, hold tight to the leash and anticipate warning sounds from Charlie as he tries to educate them on wearing protective gear and observing the rules of the road.</p>	
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="icon"><img class="" src="images/stranger@1x.png" alt=""></span>
						<h4 class="name">Strangers</h4>
						<p class="text">Charlie often feels like he is the protector. It’s his self-appointed job in our household because he believes in being gainfully employed. In the event of strangers, it’s best to avoid. Charlie has body language that is sometimes misinterpreted by human brains and he may feel like he is supposed to protect you. Unless Charlie has been formally introduced to a new friend, he will believe they are trying to kill everyone he cares about.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="icon"><img class="" src="images/catbutt@1x.png" alt=""></span>
						<h4 class="name">Cats</h4>
						<p class="text">Our neighborhood has a lot of sidewalk cats. If passing, hold tight and pull him close to you. He won’t harm them, but will feel like he should try to make friends due to having cat roommates. The best plan of action is the ignore them and pretend they are not happening. At home, Charlie often forgets he is dog-sized and tries to be cat-sized with the cats (Gorp and Peepee). Since they exclude him from their Cat Club, he gets jealous and will whine or try to interrupt meetings with disrupting, sudden dog behavior. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="icon"><img class="down left" src="images/wolf@1x.png" alt=""></span>
						<h4 class="name">Other Dogs</h4>
						<p class="text">If approached by an unfamiliar dog, follow the cues. If other dog is not growling or attempting to mount, butt sniffing may then safely occur. If Charlie becomes Statue Dog, be sure to keep him close and avoid contact.</p>

				<p>This is easy. If you’ve ever tapped someone on the shoulder or grazed a couch on your way to the fridge, you really can’t go wrong here except if you’re too aggressive. If you fear your ability to properly pet Charlie, you can practice by resting a hand on a friend’s head or scratching your shoulder.</p>

			<p>When Charlie completes one of these commands, always reward him with praise + pet or a cookie. Never both. They are equally weighted. No one should be praised for eating a cookie. </p>
